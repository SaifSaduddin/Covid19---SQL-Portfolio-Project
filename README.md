A big thanks to ALEX who has been my mentor and helped me a lot during the learning process of becoming a DATA ANALYST. 

All of his video tutorial were extremely useful and helped me a lot to be what I am today.

I have been able to land my first ever Data Analyst role because of him

Now I know what to do and how to start and become successful in the Data Analyst field even though I am still in learning phase!

It was quite a challenge for everyone who is thinking of a potential career change because at the beginning, none of us would have proper idea and knowledge on what to learn and where to begin!

ALEX really did a great job, guiding a lot of aspiring students who want a career switch and this project is in dedication to him.

I was inspired by him to complete the video tutorial and finish this entire project.

Forever grateful to ALEX.

Thank you everyone.

Reach me to my email or any other platform you may find in my profile if you have any questions.

Keep up the good work, guys!

Good luck 

And become a great Data Analyst and I wish you guys all the success in the world.
